  - Hey, you there! We reviewed your club application.
  - I'm sorry to say you didn't make the cut for our exclusive club.
  - What? Why not?
  - Our club seeks individuals with very specific qualities, and you didn't quite
    meet our criteria.
  - We're looking for those who can solve intricate puzzles.
  - I thought I had what it takes.
  - You were close, but not close enough. Sorry.
  - I'll prove myself and come back even stronger!
  - Filler
